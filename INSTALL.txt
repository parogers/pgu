To install (as root):

$ python setup.py install

If you are using ubutunu you may need to install python*-dev.

To distribute with your application:

copy the pgu/* and data/* trees into the main dir of your application.
You only need to copy the data/* trees if you are using pgu.gui and using
one of the included themes.

For example:

    if pgu is located at:
    /home/phil/pgu-1.0/
    
    and my app is located at:
    /home/phil/mygame/
    
    For distribution, I should:
    cp -rf /home/phil/pgu-1.0/pgu /home/phil/mygame/pgu
    cp -rf /home/phil/pgu-1.0/data /home/phil/mygame/data
    
  
I suggest doing this since not everyone has pgu installed, and also while
pgu is still being released as beta (version < 1.0), there are some API breaks from release
to release.  By distributing pgu with your application you ensure that
your application will work reguardless of that.
